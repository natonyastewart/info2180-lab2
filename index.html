            <p> Track and field has been around since the start of the Olympics in Ancient Greece in 776 B.C. It was created alongside religious events and celebrations for the Greek gods where men (no women were allowed) could show off their athletic abilities. From there it spread to the Romans who continued the games until the Christian Emperor Theodosius I banned them in 394 A.D. <br> While it has grown since its inception, the first games included categories such as sprint races, long jump, discus, shot put and javelin. The track and field events in these ancient times still remain in today's sport. Victors were praised and celebrated by their home cities for their success in these games.  </p>

            <p>Specific track events include indoor and outdoor sprints. Indoor sprints range from 50 yards to 500 meters and outdoor sprints are either 100, 200, or 400 meters. Middle distance races range from 800 to 2,000 meters and long distances range from 3,000 to 30,000 meters. <br> In addition to the sprints, there are also hurdles and relay teams. Hurdles are placed on the track and the athlete must run while jumping over the barriers. Men must cross 10 hurdles in either the 110 or 400-meter race and women must cross eight hurdles at 100 or 400 meters. Relay teams are composed of four athletes who each run separate distances or legs of the race. The 4x100m and 4x400m are most common. </p>
